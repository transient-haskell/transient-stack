-- | creates an EVar.
--
-- Evars are event vars. `writeEVar` trigger the execution of all the continuations associated to the  `readEVar` of this variable
-- (the code that is after them).
--
-- It is like the publish-subscribe pattern but without inversion of control, since a readEVar can be inserted at any place in the
-- Transient flow.
--
-- EVars are created upstream and can be used to communicate two sub-threads of the monad. Following the Transient philosophy they
-- do not block his own thread if used with alternative operators, unlike the IORefs and TVars. And unlike STM vars, that are composable,
-- they wait for their respective events, while TVars execute the whole expression when any variable is modified.
--
-- The execution continues after the writeEVar when all subscribers have been executed.
--
-- Now the continuations are executed in parallel.

-- The continuation gets registered to be executed whenever the variable is updated.

-- if readEVar is re-executed in any kind of loop, since each continuation is different, this will register

-- To avoid multiple registrations, use `cleanEVar`. Transient discourages the use of loops
