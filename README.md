All the transient libraries

## What is Transient?

In the year 2010 Simon Peyton Jones wrote an article **"Tackling the Awkward Squad: monadic input/output, concurrency, exceptions, and foreign-language calls in Haskell"**:

*Functional programming may be beautiful, but to write real applications we must grapple with awkward real-world issues: input/output, robustness, concurrency, and interfacing to programs written in other languages*

Transient demostrates that this awkwad squad code can be combined beautifully using the very same operators and classes used for creating pure code. 

The list of impure effects and, in general, code that usually break composability and can be composed beautifully with transient also incudes threading, concurrency, paralelism, callbacks, resource management, Web programming in the server and the browser, exceptions, loops, non determinism, backtracking, distributed computing, recovery of execution state after shutdown and restart, blocking IO, console input ...

## Motivation
All of this is done for the glory of God. May Christ reign in the nations and the hearts. «Instaurare omnia in Christo». In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen

Nada se puede hacer sin amor, excepto destruir. Y el amor es Cristo. *Nada podéis hacer sin Mi* Jn 15:5. God inpires ever

## Introduction
One of the dreams of software engineering is unrestricted composability.

This may be put in these terms:

let `ap1` and `ap2` two applications with arbitrary complexity, with all effects including multiple threads, asynchronous IO, indeterminism, events and perhaps, distributed computing.

Then the combinations:

     - ap1 <|> ap2          -- Alternative expression
     - ap1 >>= \x -> ap2    -- monadic sequence
     - do x <- ap1; ap2 x   --   "        "
     - ap1 <> ap2           -- monoidal expression
     - (,) <$> ap1 <*> ap2  -- Applicative expression
     - ap1 `operator` ap2   -- Any binary operator

are possible if the types match, and generate new applications that are composable as well with the same operators.

Other operators like the math operators etc are also permitted if they makes sense in the context. ** Any binary operator which makes sense in pure code can be used to combine "impure" transient terms in the TransIO monad** using the above operators. This is the general definition for any binary operator:

```haskell
term1 `impureoperator` term2  = pureoperator <$> term1 <*> term2
```
Since binary operators can be composed forming arbitrary formulas, then any combination of operators that makes sense with pure terms makes sense with effectful terms within the transient monad.

Transient does exactly that.

Besides their usual meaning of these operators for single threaded programs, the operators `<$>` `<*>` and `<>` express concurrency, the operator `<|>` express parallelism and `>>=` express sequencing. They can be applied to threads, distributed processes or web widgets. So even in the presence of these effects and others, everything composes.

For this purpose transient is an extensible effects monad with all major effects and primitives for parallelism, events, asynchronous IO, early termination, non-determinism logging and distributed computing. Since it is possible to extend it with more effects without adding monad transformers, the composability is assured.

Motivating example
==================
This program, will stream "hello world"  from all the nodes connected if you enter "fire" in the console

```Haskell
main= keep $ initNode $ inputNodes <|> distribStream

distribStream= do
      local $ option "fire" "fire"
      r <- clustered . local . choose $ repeat "hello world"
      localIO $ print r
```
Read the tutorial to know how to compile and invoke it.

This other program will present a link in the browser and stream fibonnacci numbers to the browser when you click it.  (if you have Docker, you can run it straigh from the console; See [this](https://github.com/transient-haskell/axiom#how-to-install--run-fast)

```Haskell
main= keep . initNode $ webFib

webFib= onBrowser $ do
    local . render $  wlink () (h1 "hello fibonacci numbers")

    r <-  atRemote $ do
                r <- local . threads 1 . choose $ take 10 fibs
                localIO $ print r
                localIO $ threadDelay 1000000
                return r

    local . render . rawHtml $ (h2 r)
    where
    fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) :: [Int]
```

This program combines both functionalities:

```haskell
main= keep . initNode $ inputNodes <|> webFib <|> distribStream
```

Plans
=====
Once composability in the large is possible, there are a infinite quantity of ideas that may be realized. There are short term and long term goals. An status of development is regularly published in [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/theam/haskell-do.svg)](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#Transient-Transient-Universe-HPlay_Lobby:gitter.im).  

Among the most crazy ones is the possibility of extending this framework to other languages and make them interoperable. treating whole packaged applications as components, and docking them as lego pieces in a new layer of the Operating system where the shell allows such kind of type safe docking. this composable docker allows all kinds of composability, while the current docker platform is just a form of degraded monoid that do not compute.
